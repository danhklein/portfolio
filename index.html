      <p>Dan grew up in southeast Michigan which was very nice thank you.</p>

      After graduating from Hampshire College, he became the first person to ever move to New York and work as a journalist. Realizing it was a rube's game, he moved to Illinois and worked as a political organizer.

     <p> He currently lives in Denver with his girlfriend and two cats. He likes the skiing and planning hikes that we will definitely go on soon. Definitely.</p>
