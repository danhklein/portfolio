      <p>Dan grew up in southeast Michigan which was very nice thank you.<br></p>

      <p>After graduating from Hampshire College, he became the first person to ever move to New York and work as a journalist. After realizing it was a rube's game, he moved to Illinois and worked as a political organizer.</p>

     <p> He currently lives in Denver with his girlfriend and two derpy cats. He likes the skiing and thinking about going on hikes. </p>
